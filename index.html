                <p>Boat trips include Murano. It is believed that glassmaking in Murano originated in 9th century Rome, with
                    significant Asian influences, as Venice was a major trading port. Muranos reputation as a center for
                    glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and destruction of the city's mostly wooden buildings,
                    ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a trip to Burano. The ancient art of lace-making has been passed down from generation to generation through the skilled hands of the Burano lace-makers,
                    right up to the present day. Our Program of Venice Tours offers the widest selection & best value in Venice Tours on-line.
